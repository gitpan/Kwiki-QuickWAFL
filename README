Kwiki-QuickWAFL

By default the Kwiki will simply surround any unknown WAFL blocks for phrases
with a div or span tag depending on if it is a WAFL Block or Phrase. This module
will change that behaviour for specified WAFL blocks and phrases and do one
additional step of processing the contents of the WAFL with the normal kwiki
formatter.

This will allow someone to easily extend the syntax without having to do a lot
of work. For example if you wanted to have a specially formatted bit of text
that is a "warning". You could have the user type:

.warning
Here is a warning
.warning

Then in your stylesheet you could style it to appear in a box, perhaps indented
with a image inserted to grab the readers attention all with CSS on the "div"
created by the WALF formatter. This module adds the ability for all normal
Kwiki formatting to take place inside the box. So the box can contain bulleted
lists, paragraphs, images, etc.
